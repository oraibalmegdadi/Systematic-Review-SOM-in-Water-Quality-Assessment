### Overview  

This review **synthesises current research** on the application of **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)** for assessing and monitoring water quality in lakes and reservoirs. It analyses how SOM has been used to reveal **patterns**, **spatial clusters**, and **ecological gradients** from physicochemical, biological, and watershed parameters, highlighting its role in advancing environmental monitoring and management.  

The study explores five main aspects:  
1. **Objectives and analysed parameters**  
2. **Datasets and sampling approaches**  
3. **Spatial and temporal scales**  
4. **Advantages and limitations of SOM**  
5. **Tools and implementation methods**

### 📁 Repository Structure  

#### **File 1 – Parameters**
**`Parameters.xlsx`** contains two sheets:  
- **Sheet 1: `Parameters-Acronym-Alphabet`**  
  Lists all environmental and water quality parameters extracted from the reviewed studies, arranged alphabetically with their corresponding acronyms.  
- **Sheet 2: `UnifiedParAcr-Freq-Class`**  
  Aggregates parameters into unified groups, showing synonyms/acronyms, frequency of occurrence, and their classification (e.g., Nutrients and Oxygen Demand, Metals/Metalloids, Physicochemical, etc.).

#### **File 2 – Metadata**
**`Metadata_Articles.xlsx`** contains two sheets:  
- **Sheet 1: `Articles-Metadata`**  
  Includes bibliographic metadata for all retrieved articles: author, year, region, study focus, dataset type, SOM configuration, and key findings.  
- **Sheet 2: `Selected-Articles-Analysis`**  
  Summarises the final set of included studies with concise notes on methodological approaches, SOM architecture, clustering tools, and interpretative outcomes.
