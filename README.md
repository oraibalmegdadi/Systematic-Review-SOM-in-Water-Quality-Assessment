# Self-Organizing Maps for Water Quality Assessment in Reservoirs and Lakes: A Systematic Literature Review
### Overview  
This repository provides the **supplementary materials and extracted data** for the article  
**“Self-Organizing Maps for Water Quality Assessment in Reservoirs and Lakes: A Systematic Literature Review”**  
by **Oraib Almegdadi**, **Joao Marcelino**, **Sarah Fakhreddine**, **Joao Manso**, and **Nuno C. Marques**,  
affiliated with **NOVA LINCS – NOVA University Lisbon**, **LNEC (Lisbon)**, and **Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, USA)**.  
The paper has been published in XXXXXXXXXXXXX [DOI].  

The review systematically analyses studies applying **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)** for assessing and monitoring water quality in lakes and reservoirs. It explores how SOM supports pattern discovery, spatial clustering, and detection of ecological gradients using physicochemical, biological, and watershed parameters.

### 📁 Repository Structure  

#### **File 1 – Parameters**
**`Parameters.xlsx`** contains two sheets:  
- **Sheet 1: `Parameters-Acronym-Alphabet`**  
  Lists all environmental and water quality parameters extracted from the reviewed studies, arranged alphabetically with their corresponding acronyms.  
- **Sheet 2: `UnifiedParAcr-Freq-Class`**  
  Aggregates parameters into unified groups, showing synonyms/acronyms, frequency of occurrence, and their classification (e.g., Nutrients and Oxygen Demand, Metals/Metalloids, Physicochemical, etc.).

#### **File 2 – Metadata**
**`Metadata_Articles.xlsx`** contains two sheets:  
- **Sheet 1: `Articles-Metadata`**  
  Includes bibliographic metadata for all retrieved articles: author, year, region, study focus, dataset type, SOM configuration, and key findings.  
- **Sheet 2: `Selected-Articles-Analysis`**  
  Summarises the final set of included studies with concise notes on methodological approaches, SOM architecture, clustering tools, and interpretative outcomes.
